# jsdoc-parse
Transforms [jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) data into something more suitable for use as template input. Also adds a few tags to the default set:

* Support for new tags in the input javascript
  * `@category <string>`: Useful for grouping identifiers by category.
  * `@done`: Used to mark `@todo` items as complete.
  * `@typicalname`: If set on a class, namespace or module, child members will documented using this typical name as the parent name. Real-world typical name examples are `$` (the typical name for `jQuery` instances), `_` (underscore) etc.
  * `@chainable`: Set to mark a method as chainable (has a return value of `this`).

## Command-line usage

This module is built into [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown/), you can see the output using this command:

```
$ jsdoc2md --json <files>
```
